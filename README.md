# Docker

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy and run application by using container. Docker is a open-source software.
Docker, Inc. is a company that developed docker tool.


What is container?

Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and deploy it as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.

Backgroud (bit of a history):

Actually the usage of container is not something which came into existance with docker. The container existed ever since the origin of Linux OS. But back then there was not formal way of containerising the application which is now very well marketed and fullfilled by Docker Inc company.

In Linux OS before docker, companies like Google used to tweek Linux OS kernel technologies like namespaces and cgroups (Control Group) to deploy their application. 
Docker company which was initially dotCloud, Inc. came up with this idea of leveraging and made it product but essentially leveraging the same same underlying technologies like namespaces and cgroup.
